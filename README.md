## Overview

### The goal

Building a script to automate stat rolling, learning how to make a gui

### Usage
To make sure the right packages are installed, in the terminal write: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
The user adds their character's name when asked and will get their character's health. They can decide if they want to add another character or not. 
At the end, there is a summary of every character and their stats (colour coordinated).

## Process

### Built with

- Python 3.9
- termcolor package

### Useful resources

- [Replit's 100 days of python](https://replit.com/learn/100-days-of-python/) - Not only did this help freshen up my memory, it also gave me the idea for a D&D stats program.
