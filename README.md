A short programn to roll stats for game characters. Will eventually be accustomed to D&D stats. Right now it is just a d6 * d8 for hp.

## Overview

### The goal

Building a script to automate stat rolling

### Usage

The user adds their character's name when asked and will get their character's health. They can decide if they want to add another character or not. 
At the end, there is a summary of every character and their health (colour coordinated). The maximum amount of health is 48 hp.

## My process

### Built with

- Python 3.9
- termcolor package

### Useful resources

- [Replit's 100 days of python](https://replit.com/learn/100-days-of-python/) - Not only did this help freshen up my memory, it also gave me the idea for a D&D stats program.
